The <a href="http://github.com/ffmike/model_plus">Model Plus</a> project is an attempt to improve on the default
Rails model generator.

Its starting point is a <a href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1315-extend-model-generator-to-create-association-declarations">patch</a>
that I wrote to extend the built-in model generator to create association declarations. That patch has been tabled in favor of
writing a proof-of-concept plugin instead.
