I was intending to write this plugin for a while. What finally pushed me along was Dr. Nic's <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/21/migrating-project-websites-to-github-pages-with-sake-tasks-new-websites-with-jekyll_generator/">post</a> on making a new project web site. So this site is both a start on my own project, and a test of Dr. Nic's latest brainstorm (which works quite well).
