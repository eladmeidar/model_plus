title: First Full Release
---

With the addition of some tests and fixing the bugs, I'm ready to call this a usable release. There are still things to do, but what's
in there now should be working. On my todo list:

* add a --create-join-table option to use with HABTM
* gemify

Anything else people would like to see?
