Description:
    Stubs out a new model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

 	If you include an attribute with a type of :references, :belongs_to,
 	:has_many, :has_one, or :has_and_belongs_to_many, the model will contain
 	the appropriate association declaration.

    You can also decorate a type with suffixes that specify further code
    generation in the model:

    title:string+a     => Adds to an attr_accessible list
    title:string+p     => validates_presence_of :title
    posted:boolean+ap  => attr_accessible and 
                          validates_inclusion_of :posted :in => [true, false]

    This generates a model class in app/models, a unit test in test/unit,
    a test fixture in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration in
    db/migrate.

Examples:
    `./script/generate model_plus account`

        creates an Account model, test, fixture, and migration:
            Model:      app/models/account.rb
            Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml
            Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb

    `./script/generate model_plus post title:string body:text published:boolean`

        creates a Post model with a string title, text body, and published flag.
